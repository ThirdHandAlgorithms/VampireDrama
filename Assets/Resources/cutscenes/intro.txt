Before you open your eyes, your ears overload your sense with the loudest of sounds.
But when you do open your eyes, you know it's not just the sounds, the bright lights everywhere takes some time to adjust to.
You remember incredible pain before you passed out, but nothing really hurts anymore.
You do sense that you're either hungry or thirsty and you smell something delicious.
It doesn't smell like something you've ever smelled before.
It's really the only thing that matters right now.
