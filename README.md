You are a new Vampire on your way to greatness.
But you're stuck in cities with streets filled with juicy bloodsacks (humans) and high risk of being recognized as a Vampire and staked to ashes.
Your goal is to survive undetected, hide from the sun and feed just enough to get to the next city until you're in control of your bloodlust and ready to enjoy the good life.
